Fitness Log React Redux Client Side Application with a Backend Rails API by Benton Wong

This application is a React Redux application to log daily fitness activity.  Users can log food, workouts, weight, and any comments providing context to that particular entry.

Data is persisted to a separate Rails API running concurrently.

## Getting Started

To install and use this application

1-Clone this entire repo containing 'react-redux-client' and 'rails-api'.
2-Start up the 'rails-api' on http://localhost:3000.
3-Start up the 'react-redux-client' using 'npm start'.
4-Upon starting and loading of the 'react-redux-client', the index page will render as the user's entry point for the application.

## Using the Application

The application has four main pages: the index showing all posts, the show page for individual post, a form page for creating new posts and editing posts.  Buttons on the page allows for easy navigation between related pages.
