Fitness Log React Redux Client Side Application with a Backend Rails API by Benton Wong

This application is a React Redux application to log daily fitness activity.  Users can log food, workouts, weight, and any comments providing context to that particular entry.

Data is persisted to a separate Rails API running concurrently.

For more information, please see the README documentation included in either the 'react-redux-client' or 'rails-api' application folders.
